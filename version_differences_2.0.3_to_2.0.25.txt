2.0.3 to 2.0.25 classes
ALL GAMEOBJECTS - a method with signature void(void) is used as virtual for collision reactions
(f. e. propelBounceAway on EnemyObjects). However, no base method for it exists.
EggObject - a -> h (no updates)
TextLabel - b -> q (no updates)
BounceObject - c -> c (no updates afaict - unused field removed (gravity X))
Matrix - d -> l (no updates)
TrampolineObject - e -> k (no updates)
UIElement - f -> r (no updates, unused field removed (String))
EventObject - g -> m (UPDATED - removed final boss timer, separated interpreter)
UILayout - h -> s (no updates afaict)
WaterObject - i -> n (no updates)
GameObject - j -> f (UPDATED - less recursion when depth sorting)
CannonObject - k -> d (no updates, except particle function omitting unused args - might have been obfuscated)
EnemyObject - l -> e (UPDATED:
after super.updatePhysics, remaining code only runs if:
(C0001b.f45e != 13 || C0012m.f320a[8] != 5)
aka
BounceGame.currentLevel != FINAL_RIDE || EventObject.eventVars[8] != 5
- might be bugfix for enemies being active after final bos beaten)
BounceGame - m -> b (UPDATED:
more games button,
new game UI width fix,
summary comparisons >= 0 instead of > -1,
summary right to left icons fix,
separate level loader,
functions for quit/title music after more games,
reset field message queue during level load,
inlined initStolenColorData to loadLevel
)
ParticleObject - n -> g (UPDATED:
removed fields v,w,x - obfuscator deleted always zeroes..?)
GameRuntime - o -> o (UPDATED:
fix incoming call music bug,
implement interface p,
remove unused fields,
paint -> call super.paint instead of gamePaint
)
GeometryObject - p -> i (no updates)
StringManager - q -> a (UPDATED: print offset of desired string on IO exception)
SpriteObject - r -> j (UPDATED: Move EventCommand.OBJ_ANIMATE handler from EventObject to SpriteObject)
IResourceHandler - NONE -> p
RMIDlet - RMIDlet -> RMIDlet (no updates)
